# what's this project about
This project was made for my chemistry class since we were supposed to take a test from compound naming and I didn't know what to code.
It was incredebly challenging, since I am not the best in chemistry class.

# how to use
Run `python main.py <compounds>`. It will print out a table of it's attributes and forms of writing.

It automatically figures out the type of the compound (if it's implemented) and element names.

# proper english documentation
All code documentation is in english, but it talks about czech grammatical rules, so it's gonna be kinda hard to understand for someone not fluent in it.
